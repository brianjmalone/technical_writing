# Technical Writing & Learning Documentation

A curated collection of technical guides, tutorials, learning documentation, and the occasional hot take from my journey from systems/computational neuroscience to data science and ML/AI engineering. Topics span Python fundamentals, ML/DS concepts, developer tooling, and systems programming—with a few indulgences for my Terminal obsessions.

## About This Collection

This is where I organize things I'm thinking about and want to share. My intention is to learn out loud and evangelize (a bit). Much of this is AI-assisted writing projects I created for my own reference, or for learning via the Learn By Teaching Model.

Modern foundation models are amazing learning tools. We *wanted* butlers, but we *got* **cognitive exoskeletons**. (They're still working on the butlers, obviously.)

Feel free to reach out with suggestions or comments.
